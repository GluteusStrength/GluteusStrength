<!--
**GluteusStrength/GluteusStrength** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

###-  Hi, I'm Jaeho, Cho.
###-  I’m currently junior in Hanyang University(ERICA). I'm double majoring in ICT(media technology) at College of Computing and Applied Mathematics at College of Science and Convergence Technology.
###-  I’m interested in AI, Data Science. Specifically, I'm interested in deep/machine learning, XAI, optimization, calculus and statistics. I believe mathematical theoeries are playing important role in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. That's why I choose to take my second major as Applied Mathematics.
###-  I always try to take a deeper look into "the reason why on every continuing steps". So, that's why i'm interested in explainable AI. Also, I think the word "explainable" can lead to precise insights of data.
###-  My final goal is to be a Data Scientist.
